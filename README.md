### Weather Forecasting Features:
1.	Location-based Forecasting: The application allows users to search for specific locations and retrieve weather forecasts tailored to those locations. It provides the ability to enter a city name, ZIP code, or geographic coordinates to fetch the weather data.

2.	Current Weather Conditions: The application displays the current weather conditions for the selected location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. It provides real-time updates to reflect the latest weather data.

3.	Hourly Forecasts: The application provides hourly weather forecasts for the upcoming hours, allowing users to plan their activities accordingly. It includes information such as temperature changes, precipitation chances, and wind conditions on an hourly basis.

4.	Daily Forecasts: The application presents daily weather forecasts for at least one week, giving users a comprehensive overview of the weather conditions over time. It includes details such as high and low temperatures, precipitation amounts, and weather descriptions for each day.

5.	Graphical Data Visualization: The application employs data visualization techniques to present weather information in a graphical format. This may include line graphs or bar charts to display temperature variations, precipitation levels, or wind speeds over time, making it easier for users to understand and analyze the data.

6.	Alerts and Warnings: The application may include alerts and warnings for severe weather conditions, such as storms or extreme temperatures, to ensure users are informed and can take necessary precautions.

7.	User Settings and Personalization: The application allows users to customize their preferences, such as choosing temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit), enabling or disabling certain weather information, or saving favorite locations for quick access.

These features collectively provide users with a comprehensive and user-friendly weather forecasting experience, enabling them to make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date weather information.
